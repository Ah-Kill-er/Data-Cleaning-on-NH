# Data-Cleaning-on-Nashville Housing
2. Data Cleaning On Nashville Housing Dataset
This project is to show the process of cleaning data by SQL queries
to covert the data into more usable form
I've Changed the date format, deleted duplicate values, handling NULL values, deleting unused columns etc
For these tasks I've used Self join, Parsing, CTE etc.
